### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineering guy living in Freiburg, Germany, with interests in software architecture, agile methods, natural language processing and Clojure. I'm a proponent of open source and care about security and privacy.

### No source code repositories

I had several code repositories published here but I took them all down. You'll find them elsewhere, linked from my homepage. This is partially related to co-pilot being a thing trained on public code repositories, but mostly because I am not a fan of monopolies. For free software, diversity is important, especially when it comes to platforms and tools.
